<p>Between 1976 and 2012 Ebola virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks have been occurring sporadically in Central Africa, mostly concentrated in remote areas, and few hundred cases in total. In late 2013, EVD was reported in West Africa for the first time with cases rapidly spreading within major cities in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. By late November 2014, the three countries had combined a total of 15901 cases (confirmed, probable and suspected) and 5674 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners had declared the west African EVD outbreak an international emergency. By mid September 2014 the first ever UN emergency health mission (UNMEER) was deployed to help overcome the outbreak in affected regions and to prevent further spreading of the disease in other regions. Although it is certainly clear that the UNMEER initiative combined with efforts from local authorities of affected countries had help prevent thousands of cases, the association between environmental factors and the onset of EVD epidemics peak has yet to be evaluated.
Previous studies have correlated precipitation and temperature with EVD outbreaks that occurred between 1976 and 2014. These findings could be partly explained by trigger events that may enhance the transmission of EVD from its natural hosts to humans and also by changes in immune response to physiologically relevant temperatures. Nevertheless, the 2014 outbreak has not been studied yet. Also, this correlation between climatic factors and EVD has not been explored for the peak of the incidence. This information could be of great help for developing predictive models of future outbreaks.</p>

<p>First, we aim to investigate if there is evidence of any association between climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall, vapor pressure and the incidence of EVD in the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Second, we also aim to look for any association between climatic factors and the onset of the peak of EVD in the districts of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.</p>
